The 16 MBTI¬Æ Personality Types
The Myers-Briggs¬Æ system consists of four preference pairs that reflect different aspects of personality‚Äîopposite ways to direct and receive energy through Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I), take in information with Sensing (S) or Intuition (N), come to conclusions using Thinking (T) or Feeling (F), and approach the outside world through Judging (J) or Perceiving (P). Most people find that one preference, in a preference pair, best describes their natural way of doing things, where they feel the most comfortable being themselves, outside of any roles they play in life.
